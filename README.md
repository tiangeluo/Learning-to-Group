## Introduction
This repository is code release for our ICLR 2020 paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06478">here</a>].

We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3 training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

## Usage
### Installation
We provide a docker image to set up the environment https://hub.docker.com/r/haosulab/shaper.

When using the docker image for the first time, please run this command to install some CUDA extensions.
```
bash compile.sh
```

Every time you start docker, please run this command to install some necessary components.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Data
We test on the [PartNet](https://cs.stanford.edu/~kaichun/partnet/) dataset. Please fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3dyI1eZVIR_Sekvy8_HPXn2becP9lqjDImoe6aVtzmHBe7w/viewform) to get access to all the data and download the HDF5 files (20GB) for the instance segmentation task. We would use the data under `/ins_seg_h5/ins_seg_h5_for_detection` to train our models and the data under `/ins_seg_h5/ins_seg_h5_gt` to evaluate.


### Train
We would first train the sub-part proposal network by running this command. The trained model would be saved in `outputs/stage1`.
```
python partnet/train_ins_seg.py --cfg configs/pn_stage1_fusion.yaml
```


Then, we train our policy network and verification network. We would run a `producer` to generate grouping trajectory and training data for a `consumer` which trains our models. The `producer` would use the newest models trained by `consumer`. Also, the `consumer` would train the model on the newest data generated by `producer`.

Our training categories (Chair, Lamp, and Storage Furniture) used in Section 5.1 have three levels of part segmentation annotations. For each level, we train a segmentation model by running the following scripts:
```
python partnet/train_producer.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l3.yaml
python partnet/train_consumer.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l3.yaml

python partnet/train_producer_remote.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l2.yaml
python partnet/train_consumer.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l2.yaml

python partnet/train_producer_remote.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l1.yaml
python partnet/train_consumer.py --cfg configs/pn_stage2_fusion_l1.yaml
```

### Test
For each shape, we would use all three levels of models to inference. Run following scripts and the results will save in the `results/`.

```
python test_scripts/run_l3.py
python test_scripts/run_l2.py
python test_scripts/run_l1.py
```

### Evaluate
For each shape, we would collect the part proposals from all three levels of models and evaluate the Mean Recall.

Please go to `eval/` and run `python run_eval.py`.
